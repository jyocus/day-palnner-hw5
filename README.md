# day-palnner-hw5

This project was to utilize the moment.js and jquery libraries in an effort to build out a day planner that dynamically tracks time. The planner would have to create hour time blocks from 8am - 5pm and change the color of those time blocks depending on the current time. This application would use the users local storage to get the current time and date based on their location. Future times would display green and past times grey. 

In addition, functionality to save each task in the planner is to be created which would aslo store locally.

 I referenced a similar project that some of my classmates had used as a benchmark to start coding here: https://github.com/sguitjens/homework5/commits/master. 

I also used a few guides on moment.js especially with linking the correct CDN to the page. https://devhints.io/moment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDGSVzEwa7A&feature=share
